# python_flask_face_recognition

Flask web app
INPUTS:
    An MP4 video or link 
    One or more face images of a specific person (front, left, and right profiles)
OBJECTIVE:
    From the uploaded video, detect and extract all video frames where the given person appears, using face recognition (TensorFlow model), and display:
        1.The frame(s) where the person appears
        2.The timestamp of each frame

STEP-BY-STEP:
     Video Preprocessing---->Face Model Integration---->Frame-by-Frame Face Detection----> Flask Integration


# Face Matching Web App (TensorFlow-based)

This is a Flask-based web application for face detection and matching in video files using TensorFlow (FaceNet + MTCNN).  
Users can either upload a `.mp4` video or provide a YouTube link.  
The app extracts frames where any uploaded face matches appear.
